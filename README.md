## üöÄ Getting Started

To get Whiz.it up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* Redis server installed and running
* Google Cloud Project with the Generative AI API enabled and API key configured
* Email service credentials for Flask-Mailman

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd whiz.it
    ```

2.  **Set up the backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure the necessary environment variables, including:
    * Flask application settings (e.g., `FLASK_APP`, `FLASK_ENV`)
    * Redis connection details (`REDIS_URL`)
    * Celery broker and backend URLs (`CELERY_BROKER_URL`, `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`)
    * Google Generative AI API key (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
    * Email configuration for Flask-Mailman (e.g., `MAIL_SERVER`, `MAIL_PORT`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`)
    * Database connection details (if applicable)

4.  **Initialize the database:**
    ```bash
    # Example for Flask-SQLAlchemy (adjust based on your ORM/database)
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
    flask db upgrade
    ```

5.  **Run the Celery worker and beat:**
    Open two separate terminal windows in the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    celery -A your_app_name.celery worker -l info
    celery -A your_app_name.celery beat -l info
    ```
    *(Replace `your_app_name` with the name of your Flask application instance)*

6.  **Run the Flask development server:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

7.  **Set up the frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install  # Or yarn install
    ```

8.  **Configure frontend environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory (if needed) to configure API endpoints or other environment-specific settings.

9.  **Run the Vue.js development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run serve  # Or yarn serve
    ```

    The frontend application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (or a different port if configured). The backend API will likely be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
